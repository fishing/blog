title: Blade Baits
---

Lipless crankbaits have a cousin called the `blade bait`. They're also (more
specifically) known as `vibrating blade baits` -- they look like a flat piece of
metal with a protrusion that causes the bait to vibrate at high frequency when
retrieved in some direction. There are usually multiple holes for attaching a
snap that goes to your mainline. If you rig using the hole closer to bait's
head, it gives the bait a wider wobble. Conversely if you rig farther from the
head, it gives a tighter wobble.

These lures are effective mainly because of their uniquely minimal profiles and
their ability to trigger a reaction strike. They occupy a place somewhere
between spoons, jerkbaits, and lipless crankbaits, utilizing elements of all
three of those baits to be successful. Folks were first drawn to these lures for
coldwater situations (e.g deep clear reservoirs) but they've since been used
year round when reaction strikes are needed to get bites.

One aspect of blade baits that is also great is that they tend to be cheaper
than their counterparts. A Silver Buddy in 2021 costs $5-10 depending on weight.
A binsky blade bait is $6. For americans, Japanese counterparts are a bit more
expensive, some because they are JDM and have to be imported and sold at a
markup by specialty firms. Others are just more expensive because they are
premium brands (here's looking at you, megabass). A Megabass Dyna Response is
$10.

Here's a timeline of notable blade baits:

* 1957: Heddon Sonic. The archetype of the modern blade bait. It was like a
  lipless crankbait, but very flat.
* 1959: Heddon Sonar, seems totally like a vibrating blade bait and predates the
  silver buddy.
* 1983: Silver Buddy by Paul “Buddy” Banks. Considered by some to be the first
  blade bait, though I find that confusing because the Heddon Sonar seems to
  predate it.
* 2007: Binsky vibrating blade bait. This pioneered the use of blade baits for
  catching lake trout in New Jersey, and it made blade baits more popular in the
  US.
* 2008: Damiki Vault. JDM offering for a very finesse vibrating blade bait.
* 2014: Evergreen Little Max (JDM). Weirdly, this one turned out to be very good
  at attracting trout and is still a favorite of anglers around the world today.
* 2014: OSP Over Ride. This lure wobbles on the fall and is designed for
  lift/fall retrieves. The wobble direction is inconsistent between falls, which
  makes it look more natural.
* 2015: Jackall Keeburn. This is one of the first lures to use circuit board
  material in the design to make the vibration frequency higher.
* 2018: Megabass Chitala: This lure is a jointed blade bait designed for
  horizontal retrieves with side-to-side action that normal blade baits lack.
* 2019: Megabass Dyna Response: A more traditional blade bait, but designed for
  winding retrieves and to be worked a bit like a crankbait instead of a
  lipless or traditional blade bait.
* 2019: Deps Circuit Vib: Another circuit board material lure that has really
  good vibration.

In recent years a lot of the innovation is from japanese luremakers refining the
concept of the blade bait, which was pioneered in the US.
